/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Create a function called showLine
 *    that logs a line of dashes to the console.
 *    ----------------------------
 *
 * 2) Update the showPlayerInfo function to
 *    use the showLine function rather than
 *    logging dashes to the console directly.
 *
 * 3) Create and use a showBlankLine function
 *    for logging a blank line to the console.
